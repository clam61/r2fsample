# r2fsample
Sample app showing some basic functionality and MVVM.  Production app would most likely include Dependency Injection with something like Dagger.  LiveData is good for communication between the View and ViewModel; we don't have anything significant in the data layer here, but in production we would use most likely use Flow to implement the data layer.
